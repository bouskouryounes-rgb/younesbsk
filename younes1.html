    <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
    <p>Msemen is more than food — it’s part of Moroccan hospitality. Families gather for breakfast around mint tea,
      freshly made msemen, and conversation. The rhythmic sound of folding and frying msemen is a familiar morning
      melody in Moroccan homes.</p>
